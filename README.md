## Description

Get Daily News is a python script which uses the newsapi.org url endpoint to get the top daily headlines. The script is
currently set to gather both US and Canadian headlines. Once these articles are gathered, they are sent to an email of
your choice in a concise and organized manner. Stay up to date with the biggest news articles across the U.S and Canada
with Get Daily News.

## Future Directions

Future plans for this project include allowing users to select their own criteria for getting news articles, and also
sending emails to multiple people. There also plans to incorporate a graphical user interface to enhance the user
experience.
